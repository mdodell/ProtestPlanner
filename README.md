# RiseUp - COSI 166b

## **Intro**  

### **Description** 

#### Protest Planner App â€” a way to organize and find social causes in real-time that are important to you. This application pulls on many different platforms, including the event creation capability of Eventbrite, and a map & route planner with live updates that is Waze. However, while online platforms such as Facebook or Eventbrite can allow socal causes to initially organize an event, it fails to provide real-time access in case unplanned events occur. This could include sudden police presence, blocked routes, unsafe zones, etc. Protest Planner is an one-stop platform to plan protests, streamline organization, and provide a powerful tool to social causes that need it. 

### Inspiration 

#### As mentioned in the descrption, one application we will be pulling from is Eventbrite, with its event creating capabilities (as seen below). This includes the following components: 

- Creating/organizing events 
- Tagging an event and being able to search based on (e.g. BLM, Womens Rights, Gun Activism, etc.) 
- Searching for events near the user's location and opt to attend them 

#### The real-time aspect is drawn from Waze, which includes certain icons that represent different indicators (police, traffice, accident)

- Placing 'markers' on the map to indicate different types of hot spots (police, conflicts, checkpoints, etc.) 
- During an active event/protest, organizers and attendees can use these markers in real-time to help inform one another 
- Real-time aspect also includes organizer's ability to send emails to their attendees to alert them before/during/after
